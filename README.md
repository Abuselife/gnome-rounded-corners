# gnome-rounded-corners

Adds rounded corners to every monitor in Gnome.

## not actively maintained

As I'm currently not using GNOME a lot,
my priorities have shifted a lot to other projects.
However I'll try to keep up with pull requests.


## Credits

Based on https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1434/i-like-em-curvy/
What I did is adding a setting menu to adjust the corner radius.
The menu is heavily based on https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/277/impatience/
